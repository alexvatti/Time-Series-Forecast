# Time-Series-Forecast

## Statistical Models of time series forecasting 
    1. AR: Autoregressive
    2. MA: Moving Average
    3. ARMA: Autoregressive Moving Average
    4. ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average

## Time series components include 
    1. Trend, 
    2. Seasonality, 
    3. Cyclic patterns
    4. Irregular (random) variations

## A stationary time series has 
    1. constant mean, 
    2. Constant variance, and autocovariance over time. 

## Tests for stationarity include the 
    1. Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and 
    2. Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test.
